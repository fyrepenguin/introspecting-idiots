If you want less depressing stuff, there’s another idiot in this blog. Go and check out his posts

**Anxiety** is your body's natural response to stress. It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. Learn more about it **here! (<https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety>)**

This article is little self-centered, and by no means it implies that who’s suffering from it will have it like this, some have it more severe and some have it less.

Anxiety, I knew this word from my childhood, but I only linked it only with excitement about the future and nothing else until I had my first anxiety attack on 7th Nov 2017 around 8pm. I was eating and chatting with someone and yes, the chatting was one of the factors. Since I didn’t know what it was, I just assumed my time came.

I was planning my whole life ahead just before the attack, like how I’m going to get a job, how I’m going to marry an idiot and how I’m going to deal with everything else (including naming my kid. Yes, I just turned 20 and I’m already thinking about what I’m going to name my daughter), like the whole 10 to 15 years of my life ahead that my brain can’t even apprehend it anymore. And that’s more than enough for an anxiety attack to kick in.

If it was any other day, I would’ve just let it run its course and die like that. It would’ve been great. I die, and no one else would know until after few hours, no one will know whether I’ve suffered or not. But that day, I wanted to LIVE, I wanted to have a life. And that’s what triggered the attack.

I was upstairs in my room, alone. Don’t know what it was then, here are the few symptoms that I still remember, I can hear my heart racing and I can hear it in my ear like I’m using stethoscope (which increased my anxiety even more), I’m sweating profusely even though it’s a winter night, my breathing isn’t normal and felt like I’m choking, my hands are shivering so much that I can’t even open a water bottle to drink, I can’t even shout for help.Just lying there helpless.

I was on the floor with my right hand on my heart and the other on the ground trying to catch my breath with my mouth. Many say that our whole life flashes before our eyes when we’re about to die, but for me it was another person’s life which in turn made my anxiety even worse. It lasted for around 15 to 20 minutes which seems insignificant in normal time but in anxiety time…. it’s a lot.

To sum up how I really felt like at that time, here’s a quote from the great BoJack Horseman,

> “I think my heart is in my stomach, and my stomach is in my butt, and my butt ran away with the spoon.”

After catching my breath and even though my heart is still racing like before, I did what any rational adult would do, googled my symptoms to check how long I have, before I die. Turns out it’s just a panic attack (I knew it is anxiety attack and not panic attack now but at that rush I assumed it’s a panic attack).

It took almost an hour for me to get back to normal. The second attack came 2 days after, it’s little when compared to the first one, I did some breathing exercise and got to normal in less than 5 mins. And it didn’t disturb me for almost a year. And then it kicked again by the end of 2018 and somehow, I feel like it’s going to last more than any person in my life. It’s more severe and frequent now than the first one. I have trouble sleeping (the only thing I like about me, I used sleep so deep that even an earthquake can’t wake me up). I’m learning to live with it now. Accepted that it’s a part of me and that it’s not going anywhere anytime soon and I’m not going to try to control it.

I tried almost everything till now. Went to a therapist, tried medications, meditation, but it’s stronger than me and my will, every time I try to reason with my brain, we get into a debate and the anxiety always win. I should’ve controlled it a bit by now, if I did it right. But I didn’t may be because I like feeling anxious, I like feeling that breathlessness. Now that I’m thinking about it, I never had anxiety when I’m thinking about me, it’s always for someone (my best friends, my sisters, my parents). Maybe I feel that if I don’t care about people who care about me, I’m an even bigger asshole. Maybe I like thinking stuff rather than doing. Maybe If I don’t care enough about them, I might not deserve them in my life. Or maybe I’m just stupid. I don’t know. I don’t know. Our brain always tries to do what’s best for us even though they’re bad and sometimes it fucks us up (auto immune disorders and Substance Addiction, etc. in my case anxiety). Even though It fucks me up, it still thinks it’s doing the right thing. As long as it feels that way, I’m just an ignorant fuck.

Sorry for all this stupid stuff, next article is going to be a fun one. (it’ll be about my biggest anxiety of all… Social).

Here are a few memes that might help you understand what goes on our heads…. Almost daily…
